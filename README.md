# 6G-Resource-Allocation-Using-ML
The objective of this project is to explore the potential of machine learning for dynamic resource allocation in cellular networks to improve network efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance user experience. Specifically, we aim to design and implement a machine learning-based algorithm that can dynamically allocate resources to base stations based on real-time network conditions.
To achieve this objective, the project scope includes the following:

•	Collecting and analyzing historical data on network usage patterns and resource allocation in cellular networks.
•	Designing and implementing a machine learning-based algorithm for dynamic resource allocation that can learn from historical data and adjust allocation in real-time based on network demand.
•	Evaluating the performance of the algorithm in terms of network efficiency, resource utilization, and user experience, using simulated and real-world network data.
•	Comparing the performance of the machine learning-based algorithm with existing static resource allocation methods to demonstrate its superiority.
The project outcomes will contribute to the development of more efficient and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms in cellular networks, which can improve network performance and user experience while reducing costs.
**OVERVIEW OF 6G RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND ITS CHALLENGES:**
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves using algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions from data. It has emerged as a promising approach to address resource allocation challenges in cellular networks.
Traditional resource allocation in cellular networks is typically based on static methods that use average network usage data to allocate resources. However, this approach can lead to inefficient utilization of resources and reduced network performance, especially during times of high network usage.
Machine learning offers a more dynamic approach to resource allocation, as it can learn from historical data and real-time network information to predict network demand and allocate resources accordingly. By doing so, it can optimize resource allocation to improve network performance, reduce costs, and enhance user experience.
In the context of 6G resource allocation, machine learning can help address the challenges of designing a network that can support diverse user requirements and applications with varying demands for resources. With ultra-high-speed data transfer rates and low latency, 6G networks will need to be designed to support emerging applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and telemedicine, which require real-time, efficient resource allocation.
In this project, we will be using decision trees, a machine learning approach, to address the challenges of resource allocation in a 6G network. By analyzing historical data and real-time network information, the decision tree model can predict network demand and allocate resources dynamically to optimize network performance. The project outcomes will contribute to the development of more efficient and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms in 6G networks, which can improve network performance and user experience while reducing costs.
